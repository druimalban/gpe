libgpe V0.1
-----------

Lib-GPE is intended as a collection of certain utility functions that are
(hopefully) useful for more than one application. At the moment those
funktions inlcude:

- Easy but still properly forking off new processes (i.e. creating child
  processes): gpe-exec
- API for controlling the RTC daemon process, current main focus on RTC
  alarms: gpe-rtcd
- API for generating and playing sound beeps without the need for storing
  sampled data: gpe-soundgen
- Utility functions for child process window handling: xsi
