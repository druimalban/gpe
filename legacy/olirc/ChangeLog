* ol-Irc 0.0.38

- Unexpected queries closures on nick case changes should be fixed
- New escapes sequences for the text entry : \000 -> \377 to specifiy a char
  in octal, \x00 -> \xff in hexadecimal. NUL, CR and LF are not well handled.
- Embedding of the TCL scripting language. It works, but ALL variables / proc
  will change and then change again in the future.
- /load tries to load and execute scripts. Filenames ending in .tcl are
  processed as TCL scripts - in the future .py files will be processed as
  Python scripts, and .pl as Perl scripts.
- /source is now an alias of /load (instead of doing a CTCP SOURCE)
- Olirc now sends mIRC compatible CTCP PINGs (what a disgrace !)
- waitpid() crash on SunOs should be fixed (thanks Khalimero for your shell ;)
- Removed a few compilation warnings on OpenBSD (thanks bedlam)
- Use the HOME variable if the getpwuid() function returns no home directory

* ol-Irc 0.0.37 - 11.10.1999

- It is now possible to copy/paste channels topics with the mouse
- Internally : VW_output() entirely rewritten, should be much powerful
- Some messages parsing changed/added (err_unavailresource, rpl_inviting)

* ol-Irc 0.0.36 (not released)

(I didn't remember what i did during this period)

* ol-irc 0.0.35 - 06.07.1999

- Some bugfixes

* ol-irc 0.0.34 - 03.07.1999

- Ol-Irc now requires Gtk+ 1.2 to compile...
- Each notebook page has now its own text entry
- Fixed lame bugs in all functions using gdk_input_add() (Thanks Khalimero)
  In particular, /dns and name resolution should work as expected...
- Quit dialogs rewritten, should be better
- Prefs finally started ! You can change some fonts :)
- Big changes in the preferences system (not yet visible to the user)
- Texts are now buffered in each window (not yet visible to the user)
- You can now send a SIGUSR2 to Ol-Irc to make it abort() and coredump

* ol-irc 0.0.33 - 21.06.1999

- Improvements in Ignore List dialog box and when ignoring CTCP messages
- Big changes (and the final ones, I hope) in the management of Servers Lists
  Now, Ol-Irc just needs a (large) list of predefined servers :)
- Names resolution is now asynchronous (using child processes)
- New command: /dns
- To compile Ol-Irc in debug mode, you can simply type: make debug
- Bug fixes in Server_Callbacks functions

* ol-irc 0.0.32 - 08.06.1999

  A really big amount of changes. The main ones are :

- Management of channel members entirely rewritten. Members are now sorted in
  a ops/voiced/others order, and it will be easy to choose another order when
  preferences are at least implemented. User Tab completion uses another member
  list that the user will be able to sort in a different way from the channel
  member list
- Userhosts of channel members are stored as soon as possible, this allows
  quick ignore / ban, without having to retrieve the userhost mask
- Ignore box and bans menus retrieve the userhost if it is still unknown
- The status bar has changed and uses frames now
- You cannot edit the topic of unjoined channels
- Channel->Part no longer closes the channel window, you have to use
  Window->Close. I think it's more logical.
- Olirc no longer complains when receiving JOIN/PART/NOTICE messages for
  channels just left or not joined
- First implementation of scripting. The first scripting langugage will be
  Python (www.python.org) but my dreams are to allow the user to choose any
  scripting language he/she wants with Ol-Irc :)
- First attempt of internationalization/localization. I should rather use GNU
  gettext to do this kind of work. So things are likely to change again soon.
- Bugfixes in ignores dialog boxes
- New commands : /userhost /list /motd /trace

* ol-irc 0.0.31 - 15.05.1999

- Some cleanups in windows.c to allow Ol-Irc to run with the new gtk 1.2.3
  without displaying gtk-warnings

* ol-irc 0.0.30 - 08.05.1999

- Alt+Space has been replaced with Ctrl+w (or Ctrl+W) to switch to the next
  (or previous) window. Some window managers were used to eat Alt+Space events
- Olirc no longer complains when receiving messages for channels not joined
- \\x char sequences now work (x is no more interpreted)
- Added \g sequence to produce 0x07 chars, and added Ctrl+G shortcut
- Logging into files should work again :/
- Better parsing of '/dcc' commands (for instance, '/dcc chat' followed by
  spaces should no longer crash)
- You can't any more send text to non-joined channels (e.g. after a kick)
- Menu 'Ol-irc->Disconnect' replaced with 'Quit All', and it now works
- You can't any more DCC Send empty files (that made olirc crash). But you can
  still accept empty files sent to you - and olirc will crash if you do that
- First implementation of messages Ignores. /ignore command does not work yet.
  Ol-Irc can't yet retrieve the full userhost of a nick, so the only ignore
  mask proposed for now is "Nick!*@*". You have to modify it by hand if it is
  not suitable for you. Ignore List dialog box does not work well with
  gtk 1.0.  This might be fixed later. Please upgrade to 1.2 ! Note : If you
  want to unignore someone, you have to do Server->Ignore List->Remove.
- Fixed a serious bug that made olirc crash when opening a new server just
  after having closed one. Many thanks to Khalimero and Rouc :)
- DCC Send/Get dialog boxes code patched by Khalimero
- Chars > 128 are now displayed well in server raw windows
- Removed some compilation warnings
- DCC Send now handles filenames with spaces (spaces are replaced with '_')

* ol-irc 0.0.29 - 06.04.1999

- Multiples Nickname Change dialog boxes can now be opened at the same time
- Multiples Logfile Fileselection boxes can now be opened at the same time
- Rewritten the Strip_Codes() function
- Finally it happened ! DCC Send/Get implemented... and (I hope :/) working 
- /join command now allows to join +k channels by accepting keys
- Fileselectors now have a "Home" button
- Fileselectors now try to remember the last directory used
- You can now send control codes, with escapes sequences \b, \r, \u, \k and \o.
  You can use Ctrl+B, Ctrl+R, Ctrl+U, Ctrl+K and Ctrl+O as shortcuts.
- Added Server->Properties menu, to allow the changes of nick/username/realname
  of a server without having to close its window first
- Fixed a bug that prevented new users (without prefs file) from starting olirc
- Olirc now displays a warning if run as root
- Important changes in the management of servers / local servers
- Colors preferences are now stored in prefs file
- Changing nick while connecting to a server no longer makes olirc crash
- DCC Chat now handles CTCP ACTION, and the /me command works in chat windows
- Now sends password (if any) when connecting to an irc server

* ol-irc 0.0.28 - 29.03.1999

- Added /action command, alias to /me, and /raw, alias to /quote
- Added /clear command to clear the window
- Added User submenu for Query windows
- Parse command line before initializing Gtk
- New command line flag: -f, makes olirc fork() on startup
- olirc -v gives a much shorter output than olirc --version
- You can now close the Console. It will be possible to reopen it in a future
  version.
- Closed connections should now be noticed at once
- The Server->Change Nick menu now works
- Fixed the CTCP CLIENTINFO answer
- CTCP VERSION reply is now more compliant with the CTCP standard
- Added CTCP SOURCE management, /source command and CTCP->Source submenu
- Added CTCP ECHO management
- New servers are opened in the right window, not always in the first one
- Servers and channels are now reopened on startup
- Added first attempt icons (made by Khalimero, thanks :)
- Checked parse_msg.c against server messages formats. I hope all messages
  managers implemented for the moment are now compliant with server messages...
- Added /banlist command, to get the ban list of a channel
- Now displaying control codes in Raw Log Windows
- Added Ol-irc->Connect All menu, that connects all idle servers
- Rewritten the management of mirc color codes

* ol-irc 0.0.27 - 16.03.1999

- Rewritten ctcp.c
- CTCP Replies preferences are now stored in prefs file
- Windows tab position are now stored in prefs file
- Very slightly modified the servers preferences interface
- Strips control codes when logging into files
- No more crashes when connecting to a server without MOTD
- make static now works will all gtk >= 1.0.4, including 1.1.x and 1.2.x
- If you want to compile olirc in debug mode, edit the Makefile after the
  ./configure and comment out the 2 marked lines at the beginning.

* ol-irc 0.0.26 - 20.02.1999

- menus.c entirely rewritten - I'm not yet proud of it, but no more ashamed
  of it :) It now works with 1.0.x as well as with 1.1.x. I hope having
  removed almost all of the memory leaks of the old code.
- Added management of CTCP TIME requests - but ctcp.c needs to be rewritten
- Fixed a bug in the entries parser: escape sequence \\ really works now.
- Added beta Tab completion for nicks and / commands
- Added beta management of SOCKS V4 firewalls (does NOT work with DCC yet)
- Slightly modified the create new window / move to another window interface.

* ol-irc 0.0.25 - 07.02.1999

- New entries parser, handle escape sequences : \n, \\ and \/.
- Cut and paste works well in DCC chat.
- First implementation of shell command line option(s).
- Ol-irc normally switches to black and white on monochrome displays, so all
  texts should be viewable.
- Bugfixes: Double-clicks on the scollbar of memberlists no longer query
  random users. No more crashes when adding new servers without connecting
  to them.  Fixed a bug that made ol-irc crash if the server connection was
  closed when DCC chating with someone on this server.
- The logging function now writes the logs into files instead of the standard
  output, but for now it writes a raw log (i.e., with style char sequences).
- The CTCP menu is now labelled 'CTCP' instead of 'CTPC' 8-) Thanks, Rouc :)
- Ol-irc now compiles with gtk-1.0.4+ and gtk-1.1.9+, so hopefully with the
  future stable versions gtk-1.2+ too. Tests made with 1.0.4, 1.0.6, 1.1.9
  and 1.1.15. Version 1.1.9 generates lots of Gtk-CRITICAL errors with popups
  menus. This is caused by a bug that has been fixed in 1.1.10. With 1.1.9 too,
  the fileselect dialog box doesn't work well. If you want to use a 1.1.x
  version, please get at least 1.1.15.
