-- INSTALL --

First, to configure the scripts for your system, type ./configure

Then you can compile olirc in two different ways:

+ Dynamically linked with gtk libraries (simply type make)
+ Statically linked with gtk libraries (type make static)

For now, olirc can't be 'installed', despite of the fact that the configure script
proposes installation options. Just copy the executable 'olirc' somewhere in your path
if you want to use it :)
