Hello!

Statement:
I allow the distribution of SPColorSlider code under GNU Lesser
General Publick License.

Actually I changed the license notice for these files in sodipodi
code as well, so the code synchronization can be easier, if
needed.
Btw,
it is possible it has some nasty rendering bug, that causes
crashes under pixmap Gtk+ theme. If you happen to find and fix
it, let me know also ;-)

Best wishes,
Lauris Kaplinski
