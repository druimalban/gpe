hh.org is a big site, and his wiki, is very useful, but it is not always evident to find the information.
Here are some usefull stuff to be quickly used to handhelds.org and gpe developement environment.

* CVS:
If you read this, you have successfully checked out the CVS.
Note that if you want to commit your work you'll have to ask for an account.

* Compile and Run:
There are *many* way to compile for the arm-linux.

- Cross Compiling. 
http://www.handhelds.org/z/wiki/Toolchains
This is a way...
but, you then will need to add all the library and headers manually (gtk, gdk, etc), as some are known not to cross compile.
And there are many lib version pb as the prebuild toolchains are a little old.

- Native compiling.
The best way IMHO, is to compile natively. There are 2 way to do that.
  - on your ipaq:
	You 'll have to configure a NFS root, mount it and chroot to it. I dont have tried.
  - on the hh.org machines:
	skiff cluster is the most easy.

You should start to debug your interface directly on you PC, and only test on the ipaq only 
for the PDA specific features. Try to make your app as cross-platform possible, 
do not rely on the 240x320 screen for example..
Then a simple tar |ftp of your app directory into the skiff cluster should compile.
Do the reverse with the binary and lets test it on the ipaq.

We also strongly use irc:
irc.handhelds.org  -> #gpe
