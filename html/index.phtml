<h2>About GPE</h2>

<p>
The GPE Palmtop Environment provides a user interface environment for 
palmtop / handheld computers running the GNU/Linux or any other UNIX-like 
operating system. 
</p>

<p>
GPE is not a single piece of software, but an entire environment of components
which make it possible to use your GNU/Linux handheld for standard tasks such 
as Personal Information Management (PIM), network access and multimedia 
and various other purposes. Apart from its main focus to provide a GUI 
environment for palmtop / handheld computers it is useful on all sorts of mobile
devices with only limited resources.
</p>

<p>
In addition GPE provides an infrastructure for both easy and powerful application 
development and good compatibility to existing desktop solutions. GPE uses the 
<A href="http://freedesktop.org/Software/xorg">X Window System</A>, 
and the <A href="http://www.gtk.org/">GTK+ widget toolkit</A>. 
Besides providing core software such as shared libraries, and perhaps more 
importantly, the GPE environment defines standards for program design and 
interaction. It is based on the C programming language and other common 
standards such as SQL, XML, DBUS.
</p>

<p>
GPE is committed to the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">Open Source</a>
idea. All GPE core components are released under
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU</a>

libraries using the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html">LGPL</a>.
Those allow for the most free usability of the GPE system.
