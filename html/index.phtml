<h2>About GPE</h2>


<p>The GPE Palmtop Environment (GPE) is a collection of integrated
software components optimized for (but not limited to) handheld and
other input constrained and resource limited devices.  <a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/">GPE provides</a> PIM (<a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/GPE-calendar.shtml">calendaring</a>, <a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/GPE-todo.shtml">todo management</a>, <a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/GPE-Contacts.shtml">contact management</a> and <a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/gpe-sketchbook.shtml">note taking</a>), Multimedia (<a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/starling.shtml">audio playback</a> and <a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/gpe-gallery.shtml">image viewing</a>) and connectivity
solutions (<a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org/projects/gpe-mini-browser.shtml">web
browsing</a>).  
Another major goal of GPE is to encourage people to work on free software 
for mobile devices and to experiment with new technologies.

<p>GPE provides an infrastructure for easy and powerful application
development by building on available technology including GTK+,
SQLite, DBUS and GStreamer and several more common standards defined 
by <a href="http://freedesktop.org/">freedesktop.org</a>.</p>

The release of additional parts for the version 1.0 standard is planned for this year.</p>

<p>This is a quite important step for our <a href="http://gpephone.linuxtogo.org">GPE Phone Edition project</a> which works on an Open Source implementation of these standards and of course for the development of Linux based phones in general.</p>

	    <p>The shared project booth at Linuxtag was a very good experience again. It looks like Gnome, GPE, G(PE)² and Tinymail form a quite good group to cover a huge scale of different devices and interests. Like every time at LinuxTag we had a nice mixture of visitors from different areas at the booth including users asking for device support, people with nice ideas for extending our applications and interested professionals from companies. </p>
<p>Many thanks to the LinuxTag team, the Gnome people, Nils, Ole and everyone else who was involved in supporting our presence at this event. </p>

The <a href="http://gpe.linuxtogo.org">GPE website</a> looks a little bit old-fashioned, right? I tried to improve its look a little bit yesterday but my HTML and CSS knowlege is a little bit limited. I believe it is better than before but bug reports are always welcome... as soon as bugzilla is working again. :-) Of course here is always the <a href="mailto:gpe-list@linuxtogo.org">mailingist</a>.
</p>
<p>
After all this unpleasent discussions i started to move the GPE wiki to LinuxToGo as well. This is also a good chance to merge information from the CVSTrac wiki into the main wiki. We have the most important things in here now and quite some updates of things i noticed while editing the <a href="http://www.linuxtogo.org/gowiki/GpeProject">new wiki</a>.

</p>
<p>
Like always any help is appreciated - there are still some pages missing and large parts of the wiki might want some updates. Don't hestitiate to <a href="http://www.linuxtogo.org/gowiki/GpeProject">touch it</a> - its a wiki! :-)

It took a little bit longer than expected, but now all important bits are in place: GPE 2.7 is finished.
</p>
<p>
This is the first release of a new - more strictly defined - type. Currently we maintain roadmap and release information in the wiki page at http://www.handhelds.org/moin/moin.cgi/GPERoadmap.
</p>
<p>It's not intended to have a competely fixed roadmap there, but it should orient itself on the current and future requirements. We spent many hours in this release and the result is a large number of application and library improvements and bugfixes, as well as improved documentation. <img src="http://www.linuxtogo.org/files/20060119163110621_1.png" alt="relase"><br>
