        <abstract>
        This document is intended to become a complete reference manual for 
        GPE application development. At the point of starting this we have 
        various sources of information about the wisdom how to create or 
        continue a GPE application. In the past years we have been collecting 
        lots of experience in coding for handhelds devices - it is very 
        important not only to share the software but the experience that lead 
        to this software as well.

    <title>About GPE</title>
      <para>
        The GPE Palmtop Environment provides a user interface environment for 
        palmtop/handheld computers running the GNU/Linux operating system.

      <para>
        GPE is an entire environment of components which make it possible to use your 
        GNU/Linux handheld for standard tasks such as Personal Information Management 
        (PIM), browsing the web, playing music and videos, games, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
        In addition GPE provides an infrastructure for easy application development 
        and good compatibility to existing desktop solutions. GPE uses the 
        <ulink url="http://www.x.org">X Window System</ulink>, and the 
        <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+ widget toolkit</ulink>. 
        Besides providing core software such as shared libraries, and perhaps more 
        importantly, the GPE environment defines standards for program design and 
        interaction. It is based on the C programming language and other common 
        standards such as SQL, XML, DBUS.
      </para>
      <para>
        GPE is committed to the <emphasis>Open Source idea</emphasis>. All GPE core 
        components are released under GNU licenses, applications using the GPL and 
        shared libraries using the LGPL. Those allow for the most free usability of 
        the GPE system.
