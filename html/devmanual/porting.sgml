          <para>GPE is designed to run ontop of the Linux operating system, but
                it should be possible to run it on other UNIX-Like systems too.
                Most of the GPE developers don't have much experience with 
                running other operating systems than Linux on their mobile 
                devices, so any feedback about GPE running on other operating
                systems or information about what to change in GPE to make it 
                work is very important for us.</para>

          <para>Libc Flavours</para>
          <para>At the moment we usually use Glibc in systems running GPE, but
                it is reported to work with Uclibc as well. The main reason 
                not to use Uclibc in production systems/daily use is the lack
                of internationalisation support in it.</para>
