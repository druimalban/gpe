    In addition GPE provides an infrastructure for easy application development 
    and good compatibility to existing desktop solutions. GPE uses the 
    <ulink url="http://www.x.org">X Window System</ulink>, and the 
    <ulink url="http://www.gtk.org">GTK+ widget toolkit</ulink>. 
    Besides providing core software such as shared libraries, and perhaps more 
    importantly, the GPE environment defines standards for program design and 
    interaction. It is based on the C programming language and other common 
    standards such as SQL, XML, DBUS.

  <para>
    GPE is committed to the <emphasis>Open Source idea</emphasis>. All GPE core 
    components are released under GNU licenses, applications using the GPL and 
    shared libraries using the LGPL. Those allow for the most free usability of 
    the GPE system.
