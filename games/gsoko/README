What is gSoko?
--------------
gSoko is a gtk+ clone of the famous Sokoban game.
The goal of the game is to push all the boxes on the squares with a red
pattern.

gSoko is designed to run on Linux boxes, but it might also compile
under other systems where the gtk+ libs are available (e.g. Windows).

gSoko is free software, released under the GNU General Public License
(though the code is not very clean yet).

Requirements
------------
The gtk+ 1.2.0 (or better) libraries are needed (http://www.gtk.org/).
If you have The Gimp installed, you already have them.

Current and future features
---------------------------
Latest version of gSoko is 0.3.

Its features include:
 * 50 levels (more to come)
 * automatically save/reload level to/from $HOME/.gsokorc
 * unlimited undo
 * nice graphics (thx The Gimp) 

Future versions should bring:
 * score
 * more levels
 * more customizable graphics: skins
 * cleaner code 

How to run gSoko
----------------
 * From the binaries : just execute gsoko
 * From the sources : 'make', then './gsoko'

When you quit, a .gsokorc file will be created in your home directory.
It contains the level you reached.

How to uninstall gSoko
----------------------
Just remove the gsoko directory and the .gsokorc file.
