README file for xdémineur
=========================

Xdémineur is a minesweeper game for the X Window System.

The object of this game is to find the location of the mines
hidden in the minefield and to mark their location by placing a
warning flag.  You have exactly as many flags as there are mines.
The number of flags that remain to be placed is displayed in the
top left corner of the window and a timer is displayed in the top
right corner.

The game is played using a three buttons mouse, as usual with the
X Window System.  The left button (button 1) is used to uncover
the square on which you click (hoping that a mine is not hidden
there).  The number displayed in an uncovered square indicates
how many mines are located around this square (for example, a 3
means that there are three mines within the 8 surrounding
squares).  The whole game relies on the right use of these
numbers.  The right button (button 3) is used to place a flag on
a square (this indicates that there is a mine here).  If you
click again with the right button on a square that has a flag,
the flag is changed into a question mark: this is useful if you
are trying to guess the possible location of some mine, you can
use question marks to think about it.  One more click with the
right button and the question mark disappears.  Clicking with the
middle button (button 2) on an uncovered square which has all its
flags placed around uncovers the surrounding cells which have no
flags (this will save a lot of time).

Finally, to start a new game, just click on the yellow face above
the minefield.
