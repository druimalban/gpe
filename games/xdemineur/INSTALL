INSTALL file for xdémineur
==========================

Requirements
------------

To compile and install xdémineur, you need:

* An ANSI C compiler such as the GNU C compiler, GCC.  You can
  get an up to date list of the existing GNU archives at:

  <URL:http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html>

* The X Window System (X11R4 or higher).

* The XPM library by Arnaud Le Hors.  You can get the latest
  version from the following locations:

  <URL:ftp://koala.inria.fr/pub/xpm/>
  <URL:ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/libraries/>

Compilation and installation
----------------------------

You should normally not need to edit the Imakefile but feel free
to have a look at it (there's not much to see anyway).  Then do
the usual:

   xmkmf

to generate a Makefile from the Imakefile.  Then:

   make

to compile xdémineur.  It should compile OK on most systems.
Anyway, if you have any difficulties, please send me a report (my
e-mail adress is <babafou@babafou.eu.org>) stating your
environment (operating system type and version, compiler, X
version and every information you find relevant) and a copy of
the errror messages from the compiler.

If the compilation was successful, you can try xdémineur by
typing:

   ./xdemineur

If you're happy with it, you can install the binary:

   make install

and the manual page:

   make install.man

These two commands should be run as root on most systems.
