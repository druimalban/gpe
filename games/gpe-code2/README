This is Mastermind/GTK, version 0.2.

Just type "make" to compile it, and run it from the current directory.  
If you want to run it from a different dir, you need to make sure there is
an "xpm" subdir (or symbolic link) containing the bitmaps.

This program should compile fine under unix-like systems with gtk+-1.2.0
or higher installed.  Tested under Linux/x86 2.0 and 2.2, and SunOS/sparc
5.6.  If it doesn't work on your system, let me know.

The program is public domain, which means you can do whatever you want
with the program or the source.  If you use my code, it would be nice if
you gave me some credit (and sent me an email), but you don't have to.

Instructions:  Point and click using three mouse buttons.  You figure it
out.  ;-)

Bugs:  None that I know of.

To do:
- better interface (pop-up menus for choosing colors would be nice)
- some sort of highscores
- help text
- nicer bitmaps
