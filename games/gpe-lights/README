This is XLightOff, a little game under X.
Easy to get in hands, not so easy to solve.

You can find it at :
http://sed.free.fr/xlightoff

You just run "make" in this directory, it should produce a xlightoff file.
Then you simply do : ./xlightoff and enjoy.
Under sparc/solaris, you may have to edit the Makefile to position XINC
and XLIB variables to their correct position. I should use xmkmf...

It is in the public domain.
I dedicate it to my angel.

Enjoy your life.
