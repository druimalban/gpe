Just another GTK Tetris (c)1999,2000 Mattias Wadman <napolium@sudac.org>

INTRODUCTION
------------
This is a simple Tetris clone for the GTK library, it was mainly written
for fun and to learn how to use GTK. If you have any questions, suggestions
or you want to tell me your highscore, feel free to contact me. It's
always nice to know that someone is useing the software :)

For new versions and other programs written by me, go to:

INSTALLATION
------------
Edit the Makefile and make sure everything is set right. If you run X at a
high resolution you may want to try to uncomment -DBIGBLOCKS in the
Makefile and then recompile.

Note: The source was written to work on Linux systems, but I have compiled
      it sucessfully on a FreeBSD 3.2 system too. So it should work on most
      system capable of compiling GTK.

If you need to recompile for your system type:
make clean
make

Note: Root access is required if installing in the default directory.
      Install will overwrite your old highscore file.
      The pre compiled binary included is compiled on a
      Debian 2.1 system (i386 with libc6).

To install binary and highscore file type:
make install

Note: The binary will be set to sgid games as default so it will
      be able to write to the highscore file.

The default install path is /usr/local/bin
The default highscore path is /usr/local/share/gtktetris

Have fun.
-Mattias
