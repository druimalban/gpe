need to queue up redrawing, rather than do immediately (?)

i.e. avoid getting behind the mouse (esp. when dragging)
- better to jump to most recent position


get nicer colour scheme?


work out why getting speckled junk - because of limited precision???
-- or, more likely, getting maths wrong somehow?
