                        - Repton for Linux v1.3 -

Repton is a clone of the old BBC Micro Repton game. I written it in two
weeks (so the sources are far that clean) using the svgalib library.
The original Repton game was produced on the BBC Micro and was the third
hit Repton game for Superior Software.

I release it under a Berkeley-style license.  If you like this program,
send me a postcard from your hometown :-).  Maintainers of distributions
(e.g. on CD-ROM) please drop me a note (or preferably a sample copy of
your distribution), if you include my program: this eases maintenance,
if distributions happen to contain old versions.

You can find latest version on ftp://sunsite.unc.edu/pub/Linux/games/video

Many many thanks to Jasper Renow-Clarke <cm5hdjjr@bs41.staffs.ac.uk> for
the help with the BBC Micro Repton format and for the .rep maps :-) (take a
look at the `note' file). He wrote another repton clone (for DOS), take a look
