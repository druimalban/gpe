Implement play_list_save_m3u (in src/playlist.c).

Enable dragging selected items to move them to a play list or a queue.

(Re-)enable saving play lists.

Try harder to not freeze the interface on long imports (it is very
unresponsive--especially at the start).  This could be done by way of
a separate thread.  Currently we use an idle callback.

If we do a big import and then quit before all the meta data is read,
it will only be read once we play the song.  It would be nice to
search the data base for entries which are not yet initialized as well
as those which are out of date.

Enable rating multiple songs at once.

Provide a mechanism to view all the information about a track.

Enable podcasts.
