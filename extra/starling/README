In order to build this software you'll need (the package names
correspond to Ubuntu):

    * libsoup2.2-dev
    * libgtk2.0-dev
    * libgstreamer0.10-dev
    * libgstreamer-plugins-base0.10-dev
    * libsqlite-dev
    * libglib2.0-dev
    * intltool
    * bison

If libgpewidget is installed, configure will detect that and use it.

Then, run:

  ./autogen.sh in the root of the source directory.

And, configure, make and make install as usual.
