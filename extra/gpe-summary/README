gpesummary Applet
----------------------

This is an applet for the Hildon framework, that shows a small clock in the
status bar of the hildon desktop.

To compile this invoke the following commands in the scratchbox environment:

     $ ./autogen.sh
     $ dpkg-buildpackage -rfakeroot

and you should end up with an installable debian package in the parent
directory.

Have fun!
