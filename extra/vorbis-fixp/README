Fixed Point (integer) based Ogg Vorbis audio decoder
----------------------------------------------------

The integerisation work is (C) 2002 by Nicolas Pitre <nico@cam.org>

Please make sure you correctly set the best optimisation flags for your CPU
in the Makefile before compiling.

This is a decoder only.  The resulting binary is "decoder" which should be
presented an Ogg bitstream on its stdin and raw 16bit samples will be output
on stdout.  For convenience I included the code for a little program called
"vplay" that is able to play raw audio streams on Linux.

To play a 44100Hz stereo Ogg Vorbis file, simply do:

	decoder < bitstream.ogg | vplay -b 16 -s 44100 -S

A more complete player such as ogg123 should link against this code with
little effort.

To generate the original floating point decoder, simply comment  out the
definition of FIXED_POINT in lib/fixp.h.  This is handy to compare results
if some streams appear not to play correctly.  I'll be interested in any
Vorbis stream that doesn't produce the same audible result with both modes.
