TODO:

* Download manager
* Statusbar
* Better load/reload behaviour (more tab specific)
* Preferences
* History
* Bookmarks

DONE:

* Gtk/Webkit backend
* Tabs!
* Window title bar updates according to the current tab in focus
* Avoid long titles in tabs to allow for more tabs on small screens, and at the
  same time avoiding they get too small.
