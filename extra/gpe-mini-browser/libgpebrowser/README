This is still in a drafting stage and is probably not useful for anybody yet.
And yes there is a relatively big resemblance to the gtk-webcore handling of things,
as this is meant to abstract it out of gpe-mini-browser, so we can use better 
rendering libraries in the future. Or switch easily.

Comments welcome.
