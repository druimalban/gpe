This directory provides support for various character set encodings,
based around the Windows "code page" concept.  The following is a short
tour of the main encoding classes:

	Encoding

		The base class for all encoding handlers.

	ASCIIEncoding

		Handles the "us-ascii" encoding.

	DefaultEncoding

		Internal class that handles the default encoding.  The runtime
		engine provides this encoding when it doesn't otherwise support
		code pages.

	Latin1Encoding

		Internal class that handles the "iso-8859-1" encoding.

	UTF7Encoding

		Handles the "utf-7" encoding.

	UTF8Encoding

		Handles the "utf-8" encoding.

	UnicodeEncoding

		Handles the "utf-16" encoding in little-endian and big-endian forms.

The method "DefaultEncoding.InternalCodePage()" is used to detect the
default code page supported by the runtime engine.  This method may
return 0 if there is no way for the engine to obtain a valid number.

It is possible to create your own code page and encoding handlers to
extend the set above.  This is done in the "I18N" library.
