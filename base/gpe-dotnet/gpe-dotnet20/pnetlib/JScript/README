This directory contains the JScript implementation for Portable.NET.
It is designed to be compatible with the "Microsoft.JScript" assembly
from the .NET Framework SDK.

See the file "doc/JScript-embed.txt" for information on how to embed the
engine in your own application.

For backwards compatibility, these classes are placed in the namespace
"Microsoft.JScript".  We have split them over a number of sub-directories
to make it easier to navigate the source:

Nodes
	JScript language nodes and their evaluation logic.
Parser
	JScript language parser and support classes.
Execute
	Support definitions for program execution.
Builtins
	Builtin JScript objects and classes.
Vsa
	Front-end interface to the engine.
Jsc
	Support routines for JScript programs that have been compiled to IL.
CodeDom
	Glue logic for interfacing with System.CodeDom.
doc
	Documentation files for the JScript implementation.

Where possible, we follow the ECMAScript specifications fairly closely,
as JScript is based on ECMAScript.  The specifications can be obtained
from "http://www.ecma.ch/".

Information on the public API's was divined from the Rotor sources, as
Microsoft's documentation only specifies the CodeDom interface.  The CodeDom
interface is not the core part of the API, and so that documentation is
relatively useless for building an interoperable implementation.

The implementation here is completely "in our own words" - no Rotor code
was used in its production.

The "JScript.Test" assembly is used by the pnetlib test suite to test the
internal workings of the JScript implementation.  It breaks encapsulation
by inserting extra definitions to assist with unit testing.  It should not
be used by application programs: use "Microsoft.JScript" instead.
