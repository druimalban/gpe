Developers.exe is a demonstration program for Portable.Net Monitors,
Windows Forms and Threading.

Developers implements the Dining Philosophers problem that
was used by Dijkstra to demonstrate problems with synchronization
in concurrent applications.
See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers_problem

Developers allows you to visually see the dining philosophers problem
as it is running.  Philosophers have been replaced with "Developers"
and the knives/forks/chopsticks have been replaced with keyboards/mice.
Many DotGNU & Portable.Net developers have been kind enough to
donate their mugshots so you can actually attach faces to the names
of the developers of DotGNU and Portable.Net :D.

Use the "--help" command line option to view startup configurable
options.

i.e.

ilrun Developers.exe --help
