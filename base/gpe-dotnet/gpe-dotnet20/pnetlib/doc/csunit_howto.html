<h1>CSUnit For Dummies</h1>

<br>
<p>
This document is a brief introduction to CSunit, a Unit
Testing framework for C# programs, written in C#.
</p>

<h3>About CSUnit</h3>
<p>
CSUnit is part of the DotGNU 
<a href="http://www.southern-storm.com.au">Portable.NET </a> system that can be
used to perform Unit Testing of C# programs. It has been designed with a 
minimum dependency on our C# library &middot; Pnetlib , so that this can
be used to test our library functionality.
</p>

<h3>What is Unit Testing?</h3>

<p>
A <b>Unit Test</b> is a simple piece of test code that tests one
teeny-weeny bit of your program.
A Unit Test <b>does not </b>test application level
functionality. A Unit Testing tool is a framework that makes it 
Easy to write, maintain, execute, , collect &amp;
present results from, a number of unit tests.
</p>

<h3> What can I do with CSUnit</h3>
<p>
With CSUnit, we can do all of the above. CSUnit comes with a a command line interface as of now.
We will be building support into a number of IDE's like SharpDevelop or the
DotGNU Development Environment later.
</p>

<h3> Using CSUnit </h3>
<p>
Using the CSUnit testing framework will involve the following:

</p>

<ul>
 <li> Writing tests</li>
 <li> Executing the tests and collecting/viewing results.[TODO]</li>
</ul>

<h3>Writing tests</h3>


<h4>
You should first write a class that extends
CSUnit.TestCase like this:
</h4>
&gt;&gt; TestFoo.cs<hr width="90%">
<tt>
<pre>
using CSUnit;
using System;

public class TestFoo : TestCase
{

	public TestFoo(String name) : base(name)
	{
	}
	
	protected override void Setup()
	{
		// do the initial setup -- most likely none :)
	}

	protected override void Cleanup()
	{
		// cleanup the mess this test makes
	}

	// we consider any function that starts with a Test or test as a
	// CSUnit test -- thank God for Reflection

	public void TestFeature()
	{
		
		Assert("I'm testing Foo.Feature()",Foo.Feature() == expected_value);

		// AssertEquals is especially good for testing String/Object retvals

		AssertEquals("Foo.Feature() should be \"1\" here","1",Foo.Feature());

		// OR be a bit more specific
		
		AssertEquals("Foo.Feature()==\"1\"","1",Foo.Feature());

		try
		{
			Foo a=null;
			Foo.Feature("foo");
			Fail("NullReferenceException not caught !");
			// it's obvious that I went a little overboard with the
			// error messages -- be a little less alarming :)
		}
		catch(NullReferenceException err)
		{
			//woooohooo caught it !.
		}
	}
}
</pre>
</tt>
<br>
<hr>
<p>
Each unit test you write will be a method of this
class, and should start with &quot;Test&quot; or
&quot;test&quot;
</p>

<p>
Assert() is a function that is available via the TestCase
class. The assert succeeds if the condition passed to it is true, 
and it fails otherwise. The AssertEquals() is a function that
avoids the use of the <b><i>==</i></b> operator overloading for
comparing Objects. When an assert fails, the CSUnit makes a note
that the test has failed, and if a test routine returns without any
error/failure, CSUnit makes a note that the test has succeeded.</p>

<p>
Add as many unit tests as you like . Unlike the more famous JUnit,
CSUnit does not support a GUI as of now -- but the really picky
guys may contact me for a kewl hack on this issue.
</p>

<p>
What we have seen is the simplest way to write CSUnit tests.
It is more than likely that testing non-trivial code will need 
non-trivial testing. I'll move into more detail later in a
full fledged documentation effort for CSUnit. As well as the
methods to run CSUnit tests.
</p>


<p>
CSUnit is a very simple tool that can be used to organize and easily 
execute a number of test cases, which can be built incrementally.This
document did not cover all features of CSUnit but is only meant to be 
a first step into Unit testing using CSUnit.
