This directory contains an implementation of the "System.Deployment"
assembly from the .NET Framework SDK 2.0.  This is also known as the
"ClickOnce" deployment mechanism.

We don't currently support deploying an application via ClickOnce.
Applications in Portable.NET are either installed manually, via an
operating system package (rpm, deb, gentoo, etc), or via DGEE.

All ClickOnce applications are supposed to be able to be run standalone.
We indicate this by returning "false" from the "IsNetworkDeployed" property
in "ApplicationDeployment" and stubbing out the remaining methods.
