This directory contains the source code for the "OpenSystem.C.dll" assembly,
which provides support routines to the C compiler.  It is distributed
under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License.

Note: this isn't the standard C library (or "libc" as it is usually called).
That is defined elsewhere.  The "OpenSystem.C.dll" assembly is similar in
some respects to "libgcc.a" in the gcc compiler toolchain.

Although this isn't the standard C library, it does access functionality
from such a library.  It does this by looking for an assembly called
"libc32" or "libc64", depending upon the application's memory model.

All of the classes in "OpenSystem.C.dll" are defined within the namespace
"OpenSystem.C".  The compiler assumes that these classes exist and have
certain members.
