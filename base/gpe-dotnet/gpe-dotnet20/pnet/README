Portable.NET
------------

The goal of this project is to build a suite of Free Software tools
to build and execute .NET applications, including a C# compiler,
assembler, disassembler, and runtime engine.  The initial target
platform is GNU/Linux, with other platforms to follow in the future.

The product is available under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  The latest version of the product can be downloaded
from the following Web site:

    http://www.southern-storm.com.au/portable_net.html

When you have downloaded a version of the product, it can be unpacked
and built in the usual manner:

    $ zcat pnet-VERSION.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    $ cd pnet-VERSION
    $ ./configure
    $ make

If you would like some assistance building the code or you are having
problems, then run the Portable.NET Mad Cow diagnostic utility, which
will walk you through it one step at a time:

	$ cd pnet-VERSION
	$ ./madcow

This script dumps out a "madcow.log" file which can help the Portable.NET
developers diagnose any build problems that you may be having.

See the HACKING file in this directory for more information on
building and contributing to Portable.NET.

The Portable.NET FAQ can be found on our Web site, or in the "doc"
subdirectory of this distribution.
