This directory defines a number of "profiles" for how the runtime
engine should be built.

Profiles are selected at configuration time as follows:

    ./configure --with-profile=compact

The default profile is "full", which enables all CLR features.
The other profiles can be summarised as:

    kernel

        The smallest possible ECMA-compatible configuration.  No support
        for floating-point, reflection, networking, PInvoke, multi-dimensional
        arrays, etc.  The default text encoding is hard-wired to Latin1.

    kernel-fp

        The "kernel" profile, with the addition of floating-point.

    compact

        The "kernel" profile, with the addition of reflection and networking.

    compact-fp

        The "compact" profile, with the addition of floating-point.

    tiny

        The "kernel" profile, without runtime infrastructure or filesystem
        support.

It is possible to reduce the feature set further with other "configure"
options, such as "--without-libffi", "--enable-threads=none", etc.

The runtime engine also depends upon features in "libc".  You may need
to use a stripped-down "libc" to reduce memory requirements further.

The profile files reduce the size of the runtime engine, but not the size
of the C# class library (e.g. pnetlib).  Reducing that is a separate task.
