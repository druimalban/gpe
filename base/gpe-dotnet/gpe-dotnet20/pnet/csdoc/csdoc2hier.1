.TH csdoc2hier 1 "17 June 2002" "Southern Storm Software" "Portable.NET Development Tools"
.SH NAME
csdoc2hier \- convert C# documentation into a hierarchy diagram
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBcsdoc2hier\fR [ options ] \fIinput\fR ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Csdoc2hier
reads the supplied XML input files, and converts them into
a diagram of the type hierarchy.

Specifying multiple input files is exactly the same as specifying
one input file which is the concatenation of all of the files.
Only one output collection is created.  \fBCsdoc2hier\fR must be invoked
multiple times to convert multiple input files into multiple output
collections.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B -o \fIname\fR, \-\-output \fIname\fR
Specify the name of the output file.  If not specified, the default
is standard output.
.TP
.B \-fby\-library
Organise the output by library instead of by class name.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print a usage message for the \fBcsdoc2hier\fR program.
.TP
.B \-v, \-\-version
Print the version of the \fBcsdoc2hier\fR program.
.TP
.B \-\-
Marks the end of the command-line options, and the beginning of
the input filenames.  You may need to use this if your filename
begins with '-'.  e.g. "csdoc2hier -- -input.xml".  This is not needed
if the input is stdin: "csdoc2hier -" is perfectly valid.
