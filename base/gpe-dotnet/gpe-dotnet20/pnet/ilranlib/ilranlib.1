.TH ilranlib 1 "6 July 2003" "Southern Storm Software" "Portable.NET Development Tools"
.SH NAME
ilranlib \- ranlib replacement for Intermediate Language (IL) programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBilranlib\fR [ -v | -V ] \fIarchive\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBIlranlib\fR is a stub program that replaces the usual \fBranlib\fR(1)
utility for Intermediate Language (IL) programs.

In the current IL toolchain, symbol table indices are not used, so the
\fBilranlib\fR program does nothing to the archive.  This behavior
should be sufficient to fool Makefile's into doing the right thing
for IL binaries.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-v, \-V, \-\-version
Print the version of the \fBilranlib\fR program.
.TP
.B \-\-
Marks the end of the command-line options, and the beginning of
the input filenames.  You may need to use this if your filename
begins with '-'.  e.g. "ilranlib -- -input.exe".
