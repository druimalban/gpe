<h2>1. Introduction</h2>

The ECMA specifications for C# have fairly extensive support for
localizing the strings that applications use.  However, the mechanisms
are not very "natural" to use for more than a small handful of strings.<p>

This document discusses various alternatives, with a view to devising
a common localization framework for use by both Portable.NET and Mono.
This framework may also be submitted to ECMA for consideration.<p>

<blockquote>
Note: we explicitly limit ourselves to string localization issues in this
document.  We do not consider dates, times, localized bitmaps, and the
other issues that an application must be aware of.<p>
</blockquote>

Each alternative is evaluated based on the following criteria:

<ul>
	<li>The degree of "naturalness" to the mechanism.  The more natural
		the mechanism, the more likely programmers will use it without
		being "ordered" to do so.</li>
	<li>Whether or not new features are needed in the C# language.</li>
	<li>Whether or not applications that use the proposal will continue
		to work with existing C# library implementations.</li>
	<li>Whether or not the same proposal works for both applications
		and the "corlib" runtime library.</li>
	<li>The ease of gatewaying to pre-existing localization systems
		such as GNU gettext.</li>
	<li>The ease of automatically extracting a list of strings to be
		translated into a foreign language.</li>
	<li>The behaviour when a localized string is not present.</li>
	<li>The ease of calling other house-keeping methods related to
	    localization, beyond the simple "get string" API.</li>
</ul>

We do not judge which of these criteria is desirable or not at
this stage.  Extending the C# language may be drastic, and hence may
be unattractive, but it could also lead to cleaner code, and hence
be desirable.  The decision as to which proposal to adopt is not
the purpose of this document.  This document is a starting point
for discussion.<p>

<h2>2. Definitions</h2>

<dl>
<dt>corlib</dt>
<dd>The common C# runtime library, which is called "mscorlib.dll" in
	the Portable.NET and Microsoft implementations, and "corlib.dll"
	in the Mono implementation.</dd>

<dt>String-Based</dt>
<dd>A resource system that uses the English string as the key.
	GNU gettext is an example of such a system.</dd>

<dt>Tag-Based</dt>
<dd>A resource system that uses a synthetic identifier as the key.
    e.g. "<code>Arg_MustBeBoolean</code>"</dd>
</dl>

We generally lean towards string-based systems in the following
sections, because it is easier to provide fallbacks when translations
are missing.  However, the techniques discussed remain mostly the same
if tag-based systems are used.  The primary difference is that the
programmer must extract the strings for translation manually.<p>

<h2>3. Existing Functionality</h2>

Microsoft's "mscorlib.dll" contains a class called
"<code>System.Resources.ResourceManager</code>" which can be used
to access the string resources that are embedded in
the manifest resource section of an assembly.<p>

<blockquote>
Note: this class does not yet appear in the ECMA specifications, but that
is probably an oversight rather than a deliberate omission.  We expect
that the "<code>System.Resources</code>" namespace will eventually
be standardised.<p>
</blockquote>

To access localized strings, an application creates an instance of
"<code>ResourceManager</code>" and then calls the "<code>GetString</code>"
method to access strings using their assigned "tag".<p>

The most immediate problem with this API is that it requires that
the resource manager be created first.  Since creating a new manager
for every string access is expensive, Microsoft has adopted a convention
in their own code for getting around the API's limitations.<p>

Each of Microsoft's assemblies contains an "<code>internal</code>"
class or method that caches the resource manager for that assembly
in a static field.  After the first string access, all subsequent
accesses are relatively efficient.  Microsoft's "mscorlib.dll" uses
"<code>Environment.GetResourceString</code>" and their other assemblies
typically have a class called "<code>SR</code>" within that
assembly's namespace.<p>

There is no consistency to Microsoft's approach: every assembly must
come up with its own manager caching strategy.  None of these classes
are accessible to other assemblies to improve code reuse.<p>

Using our evaluation criteria:

<ul>
	<li>The sequence "<code>Environment.GetResourceString("Tag")</code>"
		is not very natural, and quickly becomes burdensome.</li>
	<li>No new features are present in the C# language.</li>
	<li>Applications do work with existing implementations, as this is
		how existing implementations have done it.</li>
	<li>The mechanism is different for every assembly.</li>
	<li>Gatewaying is theoretically possible, if one were to change
		the implementation of "<code>ResourceManager</code>".</li>
	<li>Automatic extraction of strings is impossible.  Programmers
		must manually extract the strings, assign a tag, and then be
		diligent enough to keep the extracted versions up to date.</li>
	<li>If a localized version of a string is not present, the API
		returns <code>null</code>, which isn't very useful as a default.
		This is exacerbated by the previous point, because it is very easy
		for the programmer to forget to assign a fallback English
		string in the separate resource file.</li>
	<li>Accessing house-keeping API's is similar in difficulty to
		accessing the "get string" API's.</li>
</ul>

The use of the "<code>SR</code>" class in so many assemblies is quite odd.
It may be the result of massive cut-and-paste, or it may be the result
of some undocumented feature of Microsoft's tools that automatically
generates a class called "<code>SR</code>" in each assembly that
requires it.<p>

The "<code>SR</code>" class contains a number of standard methods such
as "<code>GetString</code>", "<code>GetObject</code>", etc.  It usually
also contains hundreds of fields that hold tag names for all of
the strings that are used by the assembly.<p>

We cannot find any evidence in the .NET Beta2 Framework documentation that
suggests that the C# tools are doing this automatically (perhaps it is
a feature of Visual Studio.NET?).  But it seems
strange that Microsoft's programmers would create classes with that many
fields on purpose, and then do it consistently across dozens of assemblies and
thousands of classes, unless there was some kind of tool support.<p>

If Microsoft is indeed writing the "<code>SR</code>" classes by hand,
then this would seem an obvious place to introduce some automation.<p>

<h2>4. GNU gettext</h2>

We describe the GNU gettext system in this section, to provide an
example of an existing localization framework that is well-deployed
and solves many of the problems we are trying to address.<p>

The system is very natural for programmers to use.  Strings
can be marked for localization as follows:

<blockquote><code>_("Hello World!")</code></blockquote>

The C pre-processor takes care of expanding this to an appropriate
call to <code>gettext</code>, or <code>dgettext</code> in the case
of libraries.  On systems without <code>gettext</code>,
the '<code>_</code>' macro expands to its argument and the program
behaves correctly, albeit only in the original language.<p>

<blockquote>
Note: gettext also has the "<code>N_</code>" macro, which is used
to mark static strings.  Because C# strings are always created
dynamically, we do not require an equivalent to this.
</blockquote>

Because the overhead of localization is so low, it increases the chance
that programmers will use it and use it consistently.  Automated tools
can scan C source code for uses of the '<code>_</code>' macro and
create English resource files ready for translation.<p>

If a translation is not available, the macro's argument provides
a meaningful English fallback.  Synthetic tag names or null strings
can never be displayed to the user by accident.<p>

If the programmer wishes to gateway to a non-gettext system, they
need only modify the definition of the macro and recompile.
Usually this isn't necessary because GNU gettext already supports
most of the popular message catalog formats.<p>

<h2>5. New C# Libraries</h2>

Because C# lacks a rich pre-processor, it isn't possible to adopt
the GNU gettext approach as-is.  This leaves us with two options:
add new libraries or add keywords to the language.  This section
explores the first option.<p>

We can create a new namespace within the C# library called
"<code>System.I18N</code>", that contains a number of classes
that manage resources for any assemblies that use it.  The
following is a simplified example of implementing a
gettext-style system:<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace System.I18N
{

using System.Collections;
using System.Reflection;
using System.Resources;

public sealed class GetText
{
    private static Hashtable managers = new Hashtable();

    public static String _(String value)
    {
        Assembly assembly = Assembly.GetCallingAssembly();
        ResourceManager mgr = (ResourceManager)(managers[assembly]);
        if(mgr == null)
        {
            mgr = new ResourceManager(assembly.FullName, assembly);
            managers[assembly] = mgr;
        }
        String str = mgr.GetString(value);
        if(str != null)
        {
            return str;
        }
        else
        {
            return value;
        }
    }

} // class GetText

} // namespace System.I18N
</pre>
</blockquote>

A real implementation would need additional house-keeping methods, culture
support, and thread synchronization.  A single resource block per assembly
may insufficient; thus requiring the introduction of gettext-style "domains".
We have omitted these details for brevity.<p>

The effect of C's '<code>_</code>' macro could be achieved as follows:

<blockquote>
<pre>
using I = System.I18N.GetText;

class Hello
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        System.Console.WriteLine(I._("Hello World!"));
    }
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

The usage of "<code>I._</code>" is a little ugly.  If we were willing
to modify the core system library, we could do the following:<p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace System
{

using System.I18N;

public class Object
{
    ...

    protected static String _(String value)
    {
        return System.I18N.GetText.GetString(value);
    }

    ...
} // class Object

} // namespace System
</pre>
</blockquote>

This would make the definition available to all classes uniformly.
However, it wouldn't be backwards compatible with pre-existing
C# system libraries.<p>

Using our evaluation criteria:

<ul>
	<li>The mechanism is almost as natural to use as GNU gettext.</li>
	<li>No new features are needed in the C# language.</li>
	<li>Applications that use this will not work with existing C#
		libraries that lack definitions for "<code>System.I18N</code>".
		However, that namespace could be implemented in a separate
		assembly that is distributed with applications.</li>
	<li>See below regarding uniformity.</li>
	<li>Gatewaying to other implementations requires changes to the
		"<code>System.I18N</code>" code, but not to any applications
		that use it.</li>
	<li>Automatically extracting strings is easy.</li>
	<li>The behaviour when a localized string is not present is
		straight-forward: return the argument.</li>
	<li>House-keeping API's are simply extra methods within the
		"<code>System.I18N</code>" classes.</li>
</ul>

Placing "<code>System.I18N</code>" into a different assembly
will improve interoperability with existing C# libraries.  However,
it will be inaccessible to our own implementation of "corlib".
Thus, we will need a different mechanism for "corlib".<p>

However, this may not be too bad.  We can create a specialized
"<code>internal</code>" class within our "corlib" that has a similar
API to "<code>System.I18N.GetText</code>", and then do the following:

<blockquote>
<pre>
namespace System
{

using I = System.Private.GetText;

public class FormatException : SystemException
{

    // Constructors.
    public FormatException()
        : base(I._("The supplied value did not have the correct format")) {}
    public FormatException(String msg)
        : base(msg) {}
    public FormatException(String msg, Exception inner)
        : base(msg, inner) {}

} // class FormatException

} // namespace System
</pre>
</blockquote>

The usage of "<code>I._</code>" is consistent with that used by other
assemblies, but is redirected to a different class.  This would allow
automated extraction tools to work consistently on "corlib" and other
assemblies.<p>

The main drawback of this approach is that gateways must be implemented
in two places within the code.  This is still better than Microsoft's
approach.<p>

<h2>6. New C# Keywords</h2>

We could envisage adding a new '<code>_</code>' keyword to the
language as follows:

<blockquote>
<i>string-literal</i>:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>_</code> <code>(</code> <i>string-literal</i>
<code>)</code><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...
</blockquote>

This would be legal anywhere that a string literal is currently
permitted, except in serialized attributes.  The compiler converts
the construct into a call on an appropriate system-supplied library.<p>

The "<code>System.Object</code>" definition trick from the previous
section can be used to provide an implementation of '<code>_</code>' for
compilers that lack the keyword.<p>

Using our evaluation criteria, everything is the same as the "new library"
case, except that we have now altered the C# language.  Interoperability
with existing C# libraries remains a problem, but could be addressed
by once again treating "corlib" as a special case.<p>

<h2>7. Internal Libraries</h2>

Even with a keyword-enhanced compiler, and a rich supporting library,
we still have some problems.<p>

If we place "<code>System.I18N</code>" into "corlib", then programs that
use it will not run against existing C# libraries, even if they were
compiled with a keyword-enhanced compiler.<p>

If we place "<code>System.I18N</code>" into a separate assembly, then
all programs that use it will need to redistribute that DLL with their
program.  And the code will be inaccessible to our own "corlib",
which would need to be treated as a special case.<p>

Going back to the example of Microsoft's "<code>SR</code>" class, and
assuming that we can modify the compiler, we may be able to do better.
The compiler could automatically insert an "<code>internal</code>" class into
any assembly that uses the '<code>_</code>' keyword in its source.<p>

This class will be responsible for acquiring a resource manager,
caching it in a static field, and handling all resource requests
for that assembly.  The compiler will cause the '<code>_</code>'
keyword to call this internal library rather than one that is
assumed to be present elsewhere in the system.<p>

Using our evaluation criteria:

<ul>
	<li>The mechanism is just as natural to use as GNU gettext.</li>
	<li>A new keyword is needed in the C# language, and the compiler
		must know how to insert the special class automatically.</li>
	<li>Applications that use this will mechanism work with existing
		C# libraries.</li>
	<li>The mechanism is the same for "corlib" and other assemblies.</li>
	<li>Gatewaying to other implementations is more difficult.</li>
	<li>Automatically extracting strings is easy.</li>
	<li>The behaviour when a localized string is not present is
		straight-forward: return the argument.</li>
	<li>House-keeping API's are more difficult to access, unless the
		compiler gives the class a fixed name, with a pre-declared
		interface.</li>
</ul>

A drawback of this approach is that it makes gatewaying harder.
Interfacing to a different resource system will involve recompiling
all assemblies that have the internal library, unless one has
the luxury to modify "<code>ResourceManager</code>".<p>

One way to solve the gateway issue may be to provide an "escape hatch"
in the internal library.  This would use reflection to search for
an alternative resource manager before falling back to the standard
one.  For example:

<blockquote>
<pre>
private static ResourceManager GetManager(Assembly assembly)
{
    Type type = Type.GetType
        ("System.I18N.ReplacementResourceManager", false);
    if(type != null)
    {
        return (type.GetConstructor(Type.EmptyTypes)).Invoke(null);
    }
    return new ResourceManager(assembly.FullName, assembly);
}
</pre>
</blockquote>

This would allow future versions of the C# library to provide an
implementation of "<code>System.I18N.ReplacementResourceManager</code>"
that overrides the manager's behaviour with gateway functionality.
Existing C# library implementations won't have this class, and so
the code will fallback to a standard resource manager.<p>

This "internal library" solution introduces a lot of complexity into
the compiler, to get around deficiencies in existing C# libraries.
It may not be worth the effort.<p>
