This directory contains a copy of the GNU C pre-processor sources,
copied from gcc 3.2.  We used to use the system-installed version
of cpp, but some systems had problems and others didn't have a
version of cpp at all.

It is also a pain to undefine the system macros and replace them with
the CLI platform macros.  This way, we can get a C pre-processor that
works the way we want, with no system-dependent macro pollution.

The pre-processor has been modified to use the CLI macro definitions,
and to add the "#using" directive that is copied from Managed C++.
