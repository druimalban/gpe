Some comments about how to use the Makefiles collected here.


Makefile.dpkg_ipkg
------------------

Use a dynamic path to the "build/" directory, since the tarball
created by 'make dist' will contain the Makefile.dpkg_ipkg in
"foo-0.23/build/". Define it as follows:

,----
| CVSBUILD = yes
| ifeq ($(CVSBUILD),yes)
| BUILD = ../build
| else
| BUILD = build
| endif
`----

Then use this Makefile.dpkg_ipkg in your application's Makefile like
this:

,----
| include $(BUILD)/Makefile.dpkg_ipkg
`----

Define a variable VERSION in your application Makefile:

,----
| VERSION = 0.23
`----

This will be used by Makefile.dpkg_ipkg to build a tarball with a
version number. E.g., if your application is called "foo" (defined
in your app's Makefile in the variable PACKAGE), then 'make dist'
will create "foo-0.23.tar.gz".

Look at gpe/base/libgpewidget/Makefile for a real-world example.
