<h1>Using gpe-package</h1>
<h2>What is gpe-package?</h2>
<p>
GPE-Package is GPEs frontend for the ipkg package management system.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
The user interface is devided into three tabs providing different functionality, 
a menu to access all functions of the application not directly related to a 
control in the application window and a toolbar for easy access of the most 
important functions.
</p>
<p>
On the list tab (which is displayed on application start) you can change 
package selections by tapping on the selection box left of the package. To 
apply the package selection use the "Apply" button in the toolbar. In addition
to this you can access additional functions to update package lists, system
wide package update and list filtering.
</p>
<p>
The "Messages" tab shows all messages from the package management system 
occured during an operation. This is useful to identify problems during package
install or removal.
</p>
<p>
On the "Feeds" tab you may view and manipulate the package sources defined
on your system. Currently this is limited to adding new feeds and editing 
of these feeds defined by GPE-Package. All feeds predefined in your system are
displayed but may not be changed at the moment.
