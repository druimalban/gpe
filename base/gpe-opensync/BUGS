All works fine except:

general:
	The most problems are in the importing / exporting to gpe. The
	most issues can be solved when implementing the fields in
	libgpevtype.

	Categories won't be synced correctly, since libgpevtype has no
	support for it yet.
	

calendar: 
	(evolution): Things won't be imported by evolution, because:
	DTSTART: The time is exported as <time>+0xyz (timezone).
	evolution expects it as <time> only.
	UID: This field is missing, but evolution wants it.
	DURATION: evolution doesn't use it, it wants DTEND, which also
	does not get exported.

todo:
	When changing entries in evolution, opensync asks to Duplicate,
	Ignore or to take the Newer version, but neither of them does
	what you are expecting.

contacts:
	Some fields are not synced, like birthday, photo.

Should there be any other bugs, feel free to contact me: <martin@silef.de>
