All works fine except:

general:
	The most problems are in the importing / exporting to gpe. The
	most issues can be solved when implementing the fields in
	libgpevtype.

	When changing an item on both sides, opensync asks to Duplicate,
	Ignore, or to take the Newer item. But since libmimedir doesn't
	support the LAST-MODIFIED field it, it is doing quite hard to
	find out which is the newer one...
	When Duplicating all works fine, but on the next sync it makes
	a second duplicate on the non-gpe side. 

	Categories won't be synced correctly, since libgpevtype has no
	support for it yet.
	
	
calendar: 
	(evolution): Things won't be imported by evolution, because:
	DTSTART: The time is exported as <time>+0xyz (timezone).
	evolution expects it as <time> only.
	DURATION: evolution doesn't use it, it wants DTEND, which also
	does not get exported.

todo:
	Some fields are not synced, like state.

contacts:
	Some fields are not synced, like birthday, photo.
