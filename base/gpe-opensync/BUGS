All works fine except:

general:
	The most problems are in the importing / exporting to gpe. The
	most issues can be solved when implementing the fields in
	libgpevtype.

	When changing an item on both sides, opensync asks to Duplicate,
	Ignore, or to take the Newer item. Here are some problems:
	- Ignore doesn't work (might be a problem of opensync).
	- Newer doesn't work for events and todos, since libmimedir doesn't
	  support the tags LAST-MODIFIED, yet.
	However duplicate works. So always use that!

	Categories won't be synced correctly, since libgpevtype has no
	support for it yet.
	
calendar:
	libmimedir doesn't process the timezone, so if you created an item
	on another device it will be synced with the wrong timezone.
	If you created it in gpe, all should be fine.
	Some fields are not synced, like Alarm and Recurrence.

todo:
	Some fields are not synced, like state.

contacts:
	Some fields are not synced, like birthday, photo.
