	* gpesync_client.c, gpesync_client.h: Added. It's the communication
	backend for this plugin. It is the client for the gpesyncd.
	* utils.c, utils.h: Added. They contain general function that can
	be used by calendar, contact, todo items.
	* calendar.c, calendar.h, todo.c, todo.h: Added but no functionality,
	yet.
	* contacts.c: Ported to use the gpesyncd.
	* gpe_db.h gpe_db.c: No more needed. All conversion is made by the
	gpesyncd on the pda.

	* gpe_db.h gpe_db.c: Implemented the tags_replace_category function,
	which replaces the numbers of the cateogories to their names.
	* gpe_sync.h gpe_sync.c: Added categories list, for
	tags_replace_category.
	* contacts.c: Reading and writing now implemented.

	* gpe_db.h gpe_db.c: Files added for easier querying/handling of the
	results from nsqlc_exec().
	* contacts.h contacts.c: Moved from gpe_adresses.c/h. I thought this
	name fits better.
	Added support for reading the entries.
	Contacts get converted to a vcard and sent to opensync (works!)
	* gpe_sync.h gpe_sync.c: Some clean-up.
	Added support for contact.c.
	* configure.in : Added support for libgpevtype.
