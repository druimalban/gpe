	* gpe_db.h gpe_db.c: Files added for easier querying/handling of the
	results from nsqlc_exec().
	* contacts.h contacts.c: Moved from gpe_adresses.c/h. I thought this
	name fits better.
	Added support for reading the entries.
	Contacts get converted to a vcard and sent to opensync (works!)
	* gpe_sync.h gpe_sync.c: Some clean-up.
	Added support for contact.c.
	* configure.in : Added support for libgpevtype.
	* README : Put in a few words.
