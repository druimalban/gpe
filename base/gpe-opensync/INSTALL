Here are some guides how to sync the gpe-pims with evolution.

gpe:
You need to install gpesyncd and must be able to connect through ssh
to the gpe device. That's basically it. But to make the sync a
little more comfortable, you should use ssh hostkey authentication.

evolution:
To use the plugin you need to have opensync and multisync0.90.
You can get the latest versions with subversion with:

svn co http://svn.opensync.org/trunk opensync
svn co http://svn.opensync.org/multisync/trunk multisync-0.90 

once both are installed you can compile with the usual commands:
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
make install

multisync-0.90 comes with some tools which make it easier to configure
opensync.
Here is an example how to sync the contacts from the handheld to evolution

First you need to install the evo2-sync plugin (see www.opensync.org
for more information).

Now add a synchronization group:
msynctool --addgroup gpe-evo

Now you can list your groups with:
msynctool --listgroups

Now we need to add members to this sync-group, by typing:
msynctool --addmember gpe-evo gpe-sync
msynctool --addmember gpe-evo evo2-sync

After this you need to configure the plugins. You can do this with
multisync0.90, a gui, or with the commands:
msynctool --configure gpe-evo 1
msynctool --configure gpe-evo 2

After this you can sync it with
msynctool --sync gpe-evo

That's it!
