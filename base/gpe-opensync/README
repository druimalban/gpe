gpe-opensync: A plugin for opensync (www.opensync.org) to sync with handhelds
              using GPE (http://gpe.handhelds.org).

WARNING: This plugin is not yet finished. A lot of functions are still not yet
written. Although there should be no damage to your files, it is not
guaranteed that it works, so make backups!

To compile this you need to have libnsqlc installed. Otherwise it won't work.
Other dependencies should be reported from ./configure.

You must use the cvs-version of libgpevtype. Otherwise some fields won't be
synced!

See BUGS for known problems.

Have fun.
