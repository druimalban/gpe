gpe-opensync: A plugin for opensync (www.opensync.org) to sync with handhelds
              using GPE (http://gpe.handhelds.org).

WARNING: This plugin is not yet finished. A lot of functions are still not yet
written. Although there should be no damage to your files, it is not
guaranteed that it works, so make backups!

This plugin needs the gpesyncd installed on the gpe side. Syncing is done
by using ssh, so this too has to be installed.

See BUGS for known problems.

See INSTALL for help installing and configuring the plugin.

Hints for testing:
When all the syncing does not work anymore, it might help to remove the
~/.opensync folder, since opensync stores older states of the devices
and so incorrect data might get synced.
After it you need to recreate your sync pair.

Have fun.

Some personal notes:

A BIG THANKS to google, for making the "Summer of Code"
(http://code.google.com/summerofcode.html).
and a BIG THANK AS LEAST AS BIG AS TO GOOGLE, to handhelds.org for doing all
this great stuff and letting me code this while the summer of code for you.
I REALLY enjoyed it (and hopefully still enjoy it).
