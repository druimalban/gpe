A Simple Spec for Application Display/Screen Migration. 

A window capable of migration sets a property _GPE_DISPLAY_CHANGE on
itself.  Its type is also _GPE_DISPLAY_CHANGE and it is initially set
to zero length.

Changing this property to a non-empty value will signal the
application to migrate.  The format for the property is:

 0  initiating window handle (32 bits, network byte order)
 4  property to be used for error response (32 bits, network byte order)
 8  destination screen (string in "host:display.screen" notation)

A successful migration will result in the application generating a
destroyNotify event on its original display.  Following successful
migration, the application must reset the _GPE_DISPLAY_CHANGE
property to zero length to indicate that it is safe to request further
migrations.

If migration fails, the application generates a textual error message
and deposits this as a STRING property using the window handle and
atom that were specified in the original migration request.
Initiating applications can set these fields to None, in which case
errors are not reported.
