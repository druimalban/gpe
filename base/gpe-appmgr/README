Introduction to GPE
===================

GPE is the GNU Palmtop Environment.

It is a free (as in speech) environment designed for handheld computers such
as the iPAQ. It is based around X11 and GTK.

See http://www.handhelds.org/projects/GPE/ for more information.

============
Installation
============
 1) On a local system
    Just run 'make install'

 2) On an iPAQ running familiar
    Run 'make ipk', then install the new package via ipkg

===
Use
===
Tap an icon to launch the program. If possible, gpe-appmgr will bring
a currently-running copy of the program to the front.

Hold the pen down on an icon to bring up a list of options.
 [Window titles of currently running programs]
 Force Run
 Properties

Click on a window title to bring that specific window to the front. This is
especially useful for Dillo, for example.

"Force Run" causes the program to run again, even if it is already running. Do
this to launch a second (or third) terminal/whatever.

"Properties" will show you a list of properties associated with that menu
entry. At the moment, you cannot edit these properties.

===============
Menu extensions
===============

For its extra functionality, extensions to the normal menu format
were needed. They are:
 icon16=
 icon48=
 windowtitle=
and are for
 16x16 icons
 48x48 icons
 Window title of already running process.
respectively.

Note that the icons need not (indeed, should not) have paths
specified. Thus if installed to a network on a CompactFlash
card, the icon will still be available.

The window title may include "*", it is expanded in the same way
file names are.

An example for "Dillo", a small web browser:

?package(dillo):\
 needs=x11\
 section=Viewers\
 command=dillo\
 title=Dillo\
 icon48=dillo.png\
 windowtitle="Dillo:*"

============
Config Files
============

Most people won't need this; the 'Appmgr Setup' applet should take
care of most people's needs.

 -= ~/.gpe/gpe-appmgr =-

A file in the package menu format used by Debian.

Options:
 show_all_group ("yes" or "no")  [Default: "no"]
 Controls whether the special "All" tab is displayed.

 auto_hide_group_labels ("yes" or "no")  [Default: "yes"]
 Controls whether to hide the names of the tabs other than the
 currently active one.

 tab_view ("list" or "icon") [Default: "list"]
 Whether to show a list of programs or a proper application launcher
 icon display

Eg:
<SNIP>
?package(gpe-appmgr): show_all_group="yes" tab_view="icon" auto_hide_group_labels="yes"
</SNIP>

 -= ~/.gpe/gpe-appmgr_ignored-items =-

A list of menu files to ignore, one per line.
Eg:
<SNIP>
/usr/lib/menu/scream
/usr/lib/menu/clerk
</SNIP>

 -= ~/.gpe/gpe-appmgr_group_order =-

A list of groups ordered to your specifications. Groups will be ordered in the
order listed here. "All" will be before the list (if you choose to have the "All"
group visible). All groups not specified will be appended to the end in alphabetical
order.

Eg:
<SNIP>
PIM
Viewers
</SNIP>

Might result in
 [All][PIM][Viewers][Audio][Games][System]

If a group that is listed here doesn't have any menu entries for it, it will not
be created.
