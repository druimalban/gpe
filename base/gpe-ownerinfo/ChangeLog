	* gpe-ownerinfo2.c (main): Put widgets for the actual info into a
	GtkSizeGroup so that they all get.
	* Makefile (VERSION): Define VERSION variable.
	(distclean): New target distclean which removes familiar/dist/.
	Make "make dist" work.

	* familiar/control1 (Version): Replace the version number by the
	string "VERSION" so that the new Makefile.dpkg_ipkg can replace it
	with the VERSION variable in the local Makefile.

	* gpe-ownerinfo2.c (main): Clean up. Use pango markup in places
	where it makes sense.
	(main): Make labels selectable where it makes sense (well, it
	doesn't really. Let's see.) Blue email address, yay! :)
