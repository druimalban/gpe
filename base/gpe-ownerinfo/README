README for gpe-ownerinfo
========================

/etc/gpe/gpe-ownerinfo.data can contain Pango markup if used with
gpe-ownerinfo.  

Examples:

<u>Hebrew &#x5d0;&#x5d1; &#x5d2;&#x5d3;&#x5d4; text</u>
<span size='8000'>Germany</span>
<span variant='smallcaps'>Norway</span>

Translating
-----------

Translators: please provide the po files with the language code for
your language. (The reason for this is that Pango supports language
tagging, so, for example, it will attempt to use a Japanese font for
text marked as Japanese.)

Look for comment "LanguageCode" in po/<lang>.po, then put the code
for your language in the 'mgstr'.  (Example: "ja" for Japanese)

I will then use this information to mark up strings with this
language code.

From <http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/unicode/library/l-u-pango1/index.html?dwzone=unicode>:


The most versatile element, and the one that will have the most common
use, is <span>. Like the HTML element with the same name, this marks a
span of text, and its start tag may have the following attributes whose
values will be translated into Pango text attribute values:

    * font_desc: a shorthand font description, such as 
      "Sans Italic 12" (any other span attributes override this 
      description)
    * font_family: A font family name
    * face: Synonym for the font_family attribute
    * size: Font size in thousandths of a point; a predefined absolute
      size keyword such as xx-small or xx-large, or one of the relative
      sizes smaller or larger
    * style: One of normal, oblique, or italic, corresponding to the
      allowed values of the style text attribute
    * weight: One of six keywords such as ultralight, normal, or heavy
      -- or a numeric weight
    * variant: normal or smallcaps
    * stretch: One of nine keywords such as ultracondensed, normal,
      and ultraexpanded that correspond to the allowed values of the
      stretch text attribute
    * foreground: An RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or a
      color name such as red
    * background: An RGB color specification such as #00FF00 or a
      color name such as red
    * underline: One of single, double, low, none
    * rise: Vertical displacement, in ten thousandths of an em. Can
      be negative for subscript, positive for superscript
    * strikethrough: true or false, whether to strike through the
      text
    * lang: A language code (for example, fr)


The markup language also includes a handful of convenience elements
that do not have attributes:

    * <b>: bold
    * <big>: equivalent to <span size="larger">
    * <i>: italic
    * <s>: strikethrough
    * <sub>: subscript
    * <sup>: superscript
    * <small>: equivalent to <span size="smaller">
    * <tt>: monospace font
    * <u>: underline

The absolute and relative sizes of successive steps of the size
attribute and the size increase or decrease from the <bigger> or
<smaller> elements is in the ratio 1:1.2 (or 1.2:1); this is the
same as the CSS scale factor between its text sizes.

The markup language is case-sensitive, unlike HTML (but like XML),
and the only tags that can be omitted are the pair of the <markup>
start tag and end tag.
