In order to build this software you'll need:
    * libgpe
    * libsoup
    * gtk+-2
    * gstreamer-0.10
    * sqlite3


Files are structured as follows:
    * stream.{h,c} contain the basic routines for opening the files,
        finding if they are supported and read theis metadata.
    * playlist.{h,c} implement the PlayList object, which handles al the
        streams, as well as loading and saving the user's playlist. It uses
        the gobject signal system to communicate with the streams as well as
        with the user interface.
    * lyrics,{h,c} have the code for downloading the lyrics and saving it to
        a database.
    * lastfm.{h,c} take care of sending the information on the played files to
        last.fm. You need to manually trigger the submission for now. This will
        be made automatic when NetworkManager is integrated into GPE.
    * utils.{h,c} include some utility functions for strings and tree views.
    * interface.{h,c} contain the code for initilizing the interface.
    * callbacks.{h,c} is where all the callbacks for the interface are written.
    * config.{h,c} handle the configuration files.
    * main.c only calls the initilization routines for every component.
