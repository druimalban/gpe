This is a quite crude hack to get the GTK2 based plucker viewer running
nicely with GPE.
Plase send complaints to
	Nils Faerber <nils@kernelconcepts.de>

It is based on plucker 1.6.1 source and its accompanied plucker viewer.

It is free under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 2 
(or any later version you might like to use) - see the file COPYING for 
copyright details.

Have fun!
