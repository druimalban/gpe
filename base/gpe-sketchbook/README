GPE-Sketchbook, a sketches notebook

Note that it is not yet ported to GPE (i.e. it will not appear in the Applications Manager)

Building instruction:
--------------------
FLAGS=-O2 ./configure --prefix="/usr"
make
make strip
su
make ipkg

-------------------------------------------------------------------
free add: I handle the TODO file with hnb (Hierarchical NoteBook)
it is just great! and works fine on iPAQ too, just give it a try ;)
