libcontactsdb library

This library encapsulates the gpe-contacts library 
access methods in a manner that makes them useable
not only by the gpe-contacts application (the source of
the original code) but by any app.

To use them, just
#include <gpe/contacts-db.h>
in your program and link with -lcontactsdb.

See gpe/contacts-db.h for available functions and check out
the gpe-contacts source for example usage.

Enjoy,
