This is a basic web-browser based on gtk-webcore for 
use in the Gnome Palmdesktop Environment (GPE)

I would like to thank the GPE team for the support.
Special thanks go to Kimmo Kinnunen for his support on developing 
with gtk-webcore.

If you wish to support or thank me for developing this program, 
send me a beer (preferably a Belgian one, because as a native
Belgian I have been spoiled a little there)
