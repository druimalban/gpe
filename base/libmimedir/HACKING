Coding-Style
------------

Tab-indent (tab = eight spaces), spaces before parentheses, curly braces on
same line.

CVS Commits
-----------

Please ask any maintainer (see MAINTAINERS) before committing feature
additions/changes to CVS. This is especially true for commits that change
the API or ABI! Small or urgent bug fixes can be committed without prior
consultation.
