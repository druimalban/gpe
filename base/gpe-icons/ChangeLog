	* debian/control (Build-Depends): Use Build-Depends instead of Build-Depends-Indep
	(this seems to be a Debian policy issue but this works)
	Remove Depends: as there is nothing which ever populates it.

	* debian/control (Depends): Add ${misc:Depends}

	* debian/compat: Set debhelper compat level to 4

	* debian/rules (install): Remove debhelper compat level 3 setting
