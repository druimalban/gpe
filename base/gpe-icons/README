I'm using these pages to let other people see my work-in-progress on some icons. Some of these are copyrighted and therefore not available for use without prior permission of the owner (not me). Others are used in GPL'ed software and are available for anything released under GPL.

You are free to use these icons in a GPLed project or even a proprietary one that links to LGPLed gnome-libs and thus uses those in this manner. Taking those icons from here and using in a proprietary product is a violation of the GPL/LGPL.

We have been working on a new set of GNOME toolbar icons (also called "stock" icons) because we felt it was time to give GNOME a bit of a new look. It's been years since I did the original stock icons, and my style has changed quite a bit since then, and I noticed some icons were simply not that great. So I () sat down together with Jakub (jimmac) (virtually of course, since he is in .cz and I am in .fi) and we decided it was time to do it. Ximian fully backed us so we could do this on "office hours" (you really want quotes on that one!) so we are happy to show what we have been cooking.
