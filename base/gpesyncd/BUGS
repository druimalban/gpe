general:
	The most issues can be solved when implementing the fields in 
	libgpevtype.

	Categories won't be synced correctly, since libgpevtype has no
	support for it yet.
	
calendar:
	libmimedir doesn't process the timezone, so if you created an item
	on another device it will be synced with the wrong timezone.
	If you created it in gpe, all should be fine.
	Some fields are not synced, like Alarm and Recurrence.

todo:
	Some fields are not synced, like state.

contacts:
	Some fields are not synced, like birthday, photo.

Should there be any other bugs, feel free to contact me: <martin@silef.de>
