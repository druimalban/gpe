gpesyncd - A tool to import and export vevents, vcards and vtodos.

This is a small tool to handle the exchange between the gpe databases
and the vcard, vevent, vtodo formats.

Type "help" to get some information what you can do.

You can run this program in "remote" mode, that means for everything you
want to write to it, you have to prepend the number of bytes you're
actually writing.
For example, you want to write "help", you type in: "4:help".
Sounds useless, but when using it for syncing from a remote computer
it knows when the input ends and you can even send newlines.
To activate the remote mode, just run it with "gpesyncd --remote".

Bug reports are VERY welcome!
