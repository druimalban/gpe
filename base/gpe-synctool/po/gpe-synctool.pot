"Information about setting up PIM data synchronisation for GPE \n"
"\n"
"gpe-synctools is intended to be used for PIM data syncronisation in trusted "
"networks. It provides sync access to your device without the need of setting "
"up a SSH connection. To set up syncronising just follow these steps:\n"
"1. Set up a network connection between your PC and your device running GPE.  "
"or example you can use WiFi or USB for this purpose.\n"
"2. Create a file 'gpesyncd.allow' in the '.gpe' directory  in your home "
"directory on your device. The file needs to contain the IP address of your "
"PC (or  one each line if you intend to use multiple PCs).\n"
"3. Configure the synchronisation software of your PC to connect to  1234  "
"port 6446 of your device directly (not using ssh).\n"
"4. Turn on sync access using this tool and start the sync process on your "
"PC.\n"
"In untrusted networks it is highly recommended to use ssh for sync access to "
"your device. Please refer to the OpenSync GPE plugin documentation for "
"setting up this."
