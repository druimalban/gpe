!!! means very important and is a release blocker


I can't reproduce these problems anymore:

- After editing an event, the changes are sometimes not immediately
  propagated. !!!
- create one hour event, change to all day: day view is corrupt !!!


- Zooming from week view (plus to day view and minus to month view)
- Day of week for event editor
- Edge flipping (see pannedwindow.h) for week and month view
- Scrolling for day and week view using arrow keys
- Popup menu for calendar selector (delete, sync now, ...)
- In the event list don't show the end time if there is not enough
  room
- In the week and month views, if the event span multiple days, draw
  it with jaggies, just like in the day view.
- in the month view, the first event in a day is shifted right but the
  width for formatting is not appropriately reduced.  Fix this.
- Make sure that when the time is displayed, the format used respects
  the locale.  In particular, day view events appear to be hard coded
  to use 24 hour time.

libeventdb Specific:

- change the setters to return a boolean.  if the value has really
  changed then return TRUE.  Use this (in gpe-calendar) when updating
  events to report how many events have changed, etc.

Maemo Specific:

- Tap and hold -> right click (maemo)
