!!! means very important and is a release blocker

- Change the popup menus so that instead of having:

    edit - event
         + calendar
    delete - event
           + calendar

  we have:

    edit
    delete
    calendar - edit
             + delete

  !!! (done)

- After editing an event, the changes are sometimes not immediately
  propagated. !!!
- Zooming from week view (plus to day view and minus to month view)
- Day of week for event editor
- Edge flipping (see pannedwindow.h) for week and month view
- Scrolling for day and week view using arrow keys
- Popup menu for calendar selector (delete, sync now, ...)
- In the event list don't show the end time if there is not enough
  room
- agenda is not showing duration combo in the large agenda view ??? !!!
- agenda listens for button press event, not button release event. !!!
- create one hour event, change to all day: day view is corrupt !!!
- In the week and month views, if the event span multiple days, draw
  it with jaggies, just like in the day view.
- in the month view, the first event in a day is shifted right but the
  width for formatting is not appropriately reduced.  Fix this.

libeventdb Specific:

- return GErrors in libeventdb--don't include libgpewidget
- change the setters to return a boolean.  if the value has really
  changed then return TRUE.  Use this (in gpe-calendar) when updating
  events to report how many events have changed, etc.

Maemo Specific:

- Tap and hold -> right click (maemo)
- Provide an option to set whether the agenda respects the visibility
  of calendars (required for hildon home applet) (maemo).
