1. Implement recurring events (this requires the building of an "alarm
rescheduling" code for recurring events that have alarms -- uschedule is not
smart enought to schedule more than 1 event in advance reliably)

2. Improve support for alarms.  When the alarm goes off, play a
user-selected sound and display the summary for the appointment in
question.

3. Replace hardwired font names in main.c with something configurable.

4. Add a preferences dialog to control day_view_combined_times,
week_starts_monday, and maybe other flags.

5. Fix the GtkCalendars "selected-day" problem and make it behave like the
month-view pop-ups.

6. Do database access through usqld rather than direct

7. Make it so that events can be rescheduled by dragging them around
inside day_view and month_view.

8. Make all-day events work properly.

9. Replace pervasive use of time_t with some other time representation,
so that dates prior to 1970 can be expressed.

10. Allow timezone to be specified when scheduling an appointment.
