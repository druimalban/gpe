1. Implement recurring events

2. Improve support for alarms.  When the alarm goes off, play a
user-selected sound and display the summary for the appointment in
question.

3. Replace hardwired font names in main.c with something configurable.

4. Add a preferences dialog to control day_view_combined_times,
week_starts_monday, and maybe other flags.

5. Do database access through usqld rather than direct

6. Make week-view do something useful with mouse clicks

7. Maybe move the GtkDateSels from the bottom of the window to the
top. Rationale: it might look better that way, and I keep hitting xkbd by
mistake when trying to change days. :-)

8. Find a way to stop the GtkCalendars in year-view from highlighting
their own "currently selected" day.

9. Make it so that events can be rescheduled by dragging them around
inside day_view and month_view.

10. Make all-day events work properly.

11. Replace pervasive use of time_t with some other time representation,
so that dates prior to 1970 can be expressed.

12. Allow timezone to be specified when scheduling an appointment.
