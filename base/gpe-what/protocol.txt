Simple Modal Help Protocol
--------------------------

Windows which support interactive help should set a
_GPE_INTERACTIVE_HELP property on themselves.  [Maybe WM_PROTOCOLS
would be better for this.]

When a mouse click happens in help mode, gpe-what will send a
clientmessage to the appropriate window, with type
_GPE_INTERACTIVE_HELP and payload:

l[0]	a Window
l[1]	x coordinate of mouse click relative to destination window
l[2]	y coordinate of mouse click relative to destination window
l[3]	an Atom

The receiving program should respond to this message by setting its
desired help text as a property of type STRING, using the Window and
Atom specified in the clientmessage.
