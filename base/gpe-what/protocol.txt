Simple Modal Help Protocol
--------------------------

Windows which support interactive help should advertise
_GPE_INTERACTIVE_HELP in their WM_PROTOCOLS property.

When a mouse click happens in help mode, the help application will
send a ClientMessage event to the appropriate application.  This will
have type WM_PROTOCOLS, with the window field set to the destination
window for which help is desired.  The payload of the message is as
follows:

l[0]	the _GPE_INTERACTIVE_HELP atom
l[1]	a timestamp
l[2]	a Window
l[3]	an Atom
l[4]	x coordinate of mouse click relative to destination window
l[5]	y coordinate of mouse click relative to destination window

The receiving program should respond to this message by setting a
property of type STRING on the Window and Atom specified in the
clientmessage, whose contents is the desired help text.
