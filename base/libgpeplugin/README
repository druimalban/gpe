			libgpeplugin 0.1

This library is a facility to help developers to write GTK+ applications
with pluggable modules. Simply speaking you write your gui as always without 
adding it to any container or window and then you compile it as a shared library.
Then you load all the plugins you want in the main application using the API 
described below and call a function to render all the loaded plugins. 
The result is a vertical or horizontal box with all plugins loaded in a scrolled
window.

The tree is organized as follow:

src/ 		libgpeplugin sources
include/	includes (actually just one file :) )
examples/	
  plugin_test.c		Application showing how to use the library
  plugin_foo.c		Dummy plugin 
  

It has been written in one lonely day after my girlfriend
left to paris (i love you Stefania!)
