<h2>GPE helpviewer</h2>
<br>
<p>This is the helper application for GPE. <br>
When you click a help button in an application, the help will 
be displayed in this window. The usage is pretty much similar to a web-browser.
The back button will take you to the previous page if there was one. The forward button 
will bring you back to the page you were looking at before you pressed back.
The home button should take you to a page that lists the applications and their respective help.
