-- TODO --

A lot of things !

First, all the code would better be rewritten completely :) For now, it is
awfully ugly and illogical... and that's why there is a lot of bugs :)

The management of texts have to be changed completely - scrollings are
currently awful...

Gnome support must really be added...

Olirc *should* be made compliant with all IRC standards (IRC, CTCP, DCC, etc.)
and de-facto standards (colors, TDCC, ...)
Currently this is clearly not the case !

There is currently *NO* kind of protection against lame practices like
text flood, icmp flood and so on. Do not attempt an IRC war with Ol-Irc,
you will loose before starting. (By the way, IRC wars are more than useless,
aren't they ?) A flood protection should be added anyway...



If you have made any fixes or patchs, please send them to me :)

If you have any ideas, I will welcome them too.
