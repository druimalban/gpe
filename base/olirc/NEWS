Starting from the 0.0.27 version, Ol-irc compiles both witk gtk 1.0.x and
gtk 1.2.x. For now all functions are present, whatever gtk version is used.
But this is very likely to change in a near future: New functions will work
only with gtk 1.2.x. When compiling with gtk 1.0.x, these functions will be
disabled.

Version 0.0.29 introduces (finally) the DCC Send/Get. I'm not really sure if
there is no fatal bug in the implementation, because I can't test it deeply
(it seems to work on my local loopback, but on the Internet...)

Version 0.0.30 introduces a first attempt of ignore mechanism. But you can't
yet un-ignore a nick, you have to open the server ignore list box and remove
the ignore by hand. As usual, this will be improved in the future :)

Version 0.0.32 : Ol-Irc is now capable of retrieving the userhost mask of a
nick by itself when needed. Menus User->Ignore and Control->Ban will try to
retrieve the userhost masks before anything else.
lso new in this version : Channel members are sorted by ops/voice/others. It
should be quite easy to implement other orders in the future.

Version 0.0.33 has seen big internal changes. The most visible : Names
resolution is now asynchronous (Ol-Irc shouldn't any more stop responding
when doing a name resolution (server or /dns)).

Preferences started from 0.0.34. For now, it's rather limited... but it will
become soon really *great* and very powerful :) Ol-Irc is being completely
reorganised, big changes are taking place internally. The Gtk+ 1.2.x is now
required to compile Ol-Irc, you can't any more use Gtk 1.0.x ...
