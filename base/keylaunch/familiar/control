Description: A small utility for binding commands to a hot key.
 Keylaunch is a minimal utility for associating commands with hot keys. This
 GPE version is intended for use with the special keys found on most handheld
 computers. You can connect each key to a program of your choice; if the
 program is already running, keylaunch can bring its window to the front
 rather than just running another copy.
