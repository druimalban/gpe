* sort out error codes, sqlite error codes should probably be offset, rather than the protocol errors being offset. 
* re-write server engine to be single-loop event driven to properly deal with interrupts
* ditto to support multiple database connections from the same client allong the same connections, i.e. make the whole thing more async. 
* hack vbde a bit to give the current db status (i.e. in transaction or not) so we can arbitrarily re-use spare sqlite*s)
* sort out timeouts on dis-used free sqlites* so we can keep malloc to a minimum
* some form of basic authentication mechanism
* change schema/type engine a bit, so XDR_tree s directly reference the appropriate schema rather than just the basic types. 

* Decide what to do about sqlite compatibility, whether to just
emulate everything in the client or have a wrapper.  - might be more
intutitive to re-write client to a non-callback type model.
