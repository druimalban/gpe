v0.2.0: Initial version
- re-wrote protocol using my own XDR (rfc1832) parser/writer code
  (rather than a handwritten version) 
- implemented basic server driver (one sqlite* per thread atm)
- hacked out some of the printf code from sqlite and incorperated it: 
  a bit ropey i admit, but it kind of works.
- quickly hacked sqlite shell to make it work as usqldsh
