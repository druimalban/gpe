<title>Porting GPE to a new Device</title>
  <para>
    Many developers getting in touch with GPE have some particular device in 
    mind to run GPE on. This chapter is about how to port GPE to a new hardware
    platform and what kind of software and libraries are necessary to have on
    this hardware. One additional section offers information about tools to
    create complete filesystems including GPE.

          <para>Operating System</para>
          <para>GPE is designed to run ontop of the Linux operating system, but
                it should be possible to run it on other UNIX-like systems too.
                Most of the GPE developers don't have much experience with 
                running other operating systems than Linux on their mobile 
                devices, so any feedback about GPE running on other operating
                systems or information about what to change in GPE to make it 
                work is very important for us.</para>

          <para>Libc Flavours</para>
          <para>At the moment we usually use Glibc in systems running GPE, but
                it is reported to work with Uclibc as well. The main reason 
                not to use Uclibc in production systems/daily use is the lack
                of internationalisation support in it. This lack may cause
                trouble with some GPE applications which do not support being 
                built without i18n support, but the most frequently used GPE 
                applications are known to support this.</para>

          <para>X window sytem</para>
          <para>The X window system provides the graphical backend for GTK 
                and GPE. In theory you can use GTK with different backends 
                (e.g. GtkFB) as well, but it would be necessary to remove 
                several features making use of special features of the X window
                system (e.g. tray messages and infoprints). On the most 
                platforms it is easy to make a X server work using a framebuffer
                driver. There are only a few platforms around which need special
                care to make X work at all. Hardware acceleration support is 
                useful especially for devices with higher display resolutions. 
                GPE will make use from this automatically running on X servers 
                with hardware acceleration. Typically you would use the Kdrive
                X server on mobile devices. Kdrive is part of the Xorg project
                and provides a small and fast X server with good support for 
                common mobile hardware.</para>

          <para>GTK+ and related libraries</para>
          <para>Because GTK runs on most UNIX-like platforms the availability 
                of GTK is usually not a major problem. On some platforms with 
                uncommon graphics hardware you might run into trouble with 
                some Pango issues, but that should be easy to fix.</para>
